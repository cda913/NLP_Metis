### Clusters in a Subreddit

# Learning Problem
The fans of a movie podcast ("Blank Check") have created a subreddit about the podcast. Can we find interesting topics in the subreddit that might help direct the podcast in the future? 

# Data
Data will be from the subreddit /r/blankies/. A data point is a single post. 

# Tools
Psaw to scrape the data; Pandas and Numpy to clean the data and perform EDA; NLTK and spaCy to preprocess the text; SVD or LDA to reduce dimensionality; sklearn for analysis and modeling; matplotlib and Tableau to display the data.

# MVP
The MVP will be an initial topic modeling of the posts.
